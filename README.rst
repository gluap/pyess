Python library for LG ESS Solar power converters with EnerVU app compatibility
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Python library for communication with LG ESS power converter / energy storage devices for photovoltaic solar generators

This library is **not endorsed by the manufacturer**. It was written for lack of an official API. It should allow to
design home automation around the current state of a solar energy system - e.g. turn appliances on when there is surplus
solar power. LG only offers access via a badly scriptable web page or alternatively via a proprietary app that - at least
on my phone - crashes at least twice for every successful startup.

**Disclaimer:**
For this python module I reverse-engineered the communication between the *LG EnerVu Plus 1.2.3* Android
App and the Energy Storage / Inverter device, so there is some likelihood that it will work for devices that
can be accessed via that app. Nevertheless it looks like some of the interface is delivered by the ESS as html via the
network. Therefore it may be that not all commands work against all boxes. I only have customer-level access to my own
box, so this module only offers those parts of the API that are accessible to me as a customer. As far as I can tell
the installer has higher privileges and can fiddle with internal parameters of the system from what I saw him do when he
installed the system.


Usage
=====

- `Command Line`_

 * `Fetch the device password`_
 * `Find the esses on your network`_
 * `Fetch the state from ess as json`_
 * `Graphite wrapper`_

- `MQTT Wrapper`_

 * `essmqtt as systemd service`_
 * `essmqtt config file`_
 * `MQTT discovery for homeassistant`_



Command Line
------------
This module comes with a rudimentary command line interface that allows for the following actions.

Fetch the device password
.........................

Caveat: **To fetch the device password you need to be connected to the devices wifi.** Once you are on the wifi you can
run the following to get the password. Write it down, it seems it is a static password per device::

    esscli --action get_password

The command assumes that the ess device is listening on ``192.168.23.1`` on its own wifi, in my setup it reproducibly
chooses that IP.

Find the esses on your network
..............................
Get a list of ESS devices on the local network (your home wifi, not the one of ess)::

    esscli --action list_ess


Fetch the state from ess as json
................................
fetch a bunch of json states as json and display the result on the command line::

    esscli --action get_data --password <your ess_password>

Examples for the data available:
- current power from and to the grid and the battery
- current voltage and power from both strings of the photovoltaic system independently
- current ip address
- details on grid power, battery state, daily and monthly statistics

Graphite wrapper
................

The ``log_against_graphite`` command will fetch the ``home`` and ``common`` info from ess every 10 seconds and log them against a graphite
server (assuming standard port and udp as protocol). Running this command requires the ess password to be passed on
the command line::

    esscli --action log_against_graphite --password <your_ess_password> --graphite <ip_of_graphite_server>


MQTT wrapper
------------
Sync ess state with an mqtt server (also accepts commands)
..........................................................

To connect your ESS with an mqtt server run the following in your venv::

    essmqtt --mqtt_server=<your_mqtt_server> --mqtt_user <your_mqtt_username> --mqtt_password <your_mqtt_password> --ess_password <your_ess_password>

Your ESS will show up in ``ess/#`` on mqtt.

Available values to control the ess (write true/false) **Remember that this is an MIT-Licensed software and I take no responsibility for the usage of this library. That being said I send the same commands the app would send to trigger these actions to my best knowledge.**::

   ess/control/winter_mode
   ess/control/fastcharge
   ess/control/active

I use ``mosquitto_sub`` to find the values I'm interested in while debugging like so::

    mosquitto_sub -v -h <your_mqtt_server> -p 1883 -u <your_mqtt_user> -P <your_mqtt_password> -t "#"


essmqtt as systemd service
..........................
To set up ``essmqtt`` as a daemon (systemd service) it is recommended to install it in a venv first::

  python3.7 -m venv <path_to_venv>
  <path_to_venv>/bin/pip install pyess

set up your `essmqtt config file`_ from then on ``essmqtt`` can be called via ``<path_to_venv>/bin/essmqtt``.

A systemd service file ``/etc/systemd/system/essmqtt.service`` could look like so::

    [Unit]
    Description=ESS MQTT wrapper

    [Service]
    # all essmqtt command line arguments can be used here. it is recommended to configure essmqtt in a config file
    # for this use case
    ExecStart=<path_to_venv>/bin/essmqtt
    # Restart will keep the service alive for instance in case the mqtt server goes down or isn't up yet
    # when esmqqt starts
    Restart=on-failure
    # a sensible restart delay prevents fast restart loops potentially denial-of-servicing the ess.
    RestartSec=10

    [Install]
    # we'd like to start, but only after network is up
    WantedBy=default.target
    Wants=network-online.target

It can be started like any regular service via ``systemctl start essmqtt`` or enabled for boot up starts via
``systemctl enable essmqtt``. Logs can be displayed using systemctl as well via ``systemctl status essmqtt`` or for
more lines ``systemctl status -n 100 essmqtt``

essmqtt config file
...................

To permanently configure essmqtt you can create a config file in either ``/etc/essmqtt.conf`` or ``~/essmqtt.conf``
of the user running ``essmqtt`` or you can specify which config file to load by using the argument ``--config_file``.
The config file can contain any of the command line arguments. Example::

   ess_password = <your_ess_password>
   mqtt_server = <your_mqtt_server>
   mqtt_user = <your_mqtt_username>
   mqtt_password = <your_mqtt_password>
   # optional settings
   ## sensors for homeassistant MQTT discovery (default is not set -> homeassistant autoconfig disabled)
   # hass_autoconfig_sensors = ess/common/BATT/soc,ess/home/statistics/pcs_pv_total_power,ess/common/GRID/active_power,ess/common/LOAD/load_power
   ## update interval for MQTT values in seconds (default is 10 seconds)
   # interval_seconds = 10
   ## only send the values below common every n'th update of those for home
   ## this is a debugging option that shouldn't be required, (default is 1)
   # common_divisor = 1



MQTT discovery for homeassistant
................................

**Below you find the manual setup process. If you use homeassistant operating system or one of the other installation methods that offers add-ons you can find a homeassistant add-on repo with an addon for pyess** `here <https://github.com/gluap/pyess-addon/>`_.


``essmqtt`` can provide autoconfiguration for `homeassistant <https://www.home-assistant.io/>`_.

**prerequisites:** mqtt must be set up with `mqtt discovery <https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/>`_ in homeassistant

To select the sensors that should be autodiscovered by homeassistant, provide the ``--hass_autoconfig_sensors``
argument with a comma separated list of all mqtt pathes you want to see as sensors in homeassistant. Some autodetection
of the value type is done so for instance if an mqtt path contains ``power`` it is assumed to be a power
value in watts. Of course this can also be configured in a config file.

Example config file::

   ess_password = <your_ess_password>
   mqtt_server = <your_mqtt_server>
   mqtt_user = <your_mqtt_username>
   mqtt_password = <your_mqtt_password>
   hass_autoconfig_sensors = ess/common/BATT/soc,ess/home/statistics/pcs_pv_total_power,ess/common/GRID/active_power,ess/common/LOAD/load_power



API
---
For the time being please use the docstrings in the code on https://github.com/gluap/pyess as documentation for the
API. A good place to start is pyess/cli.py where you can find the implementation of the CLI. One thing available
via the API but not yet via the CLI is the data for the daily / weekly / monthly / yearly statistics graphs that can
be accessed via the EnerVu App.
